Abstract
--------

+rediff+ is a tool for diffing documents of any text-based format by
'Sections', defined using
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression[Regular Expressions]
and marking the 'Sections' with custom, format-dependent replacement.





Problem definition
------------------


Comparing files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?diff[Diff] utility is used in
Unix-like systems for comparing two text files. It's common useage
is tracking changes in files after modification. The utility performs
comparison on per-line basis:

- Lines, present in both files are treated as 'Unchanged';
- Lines, present only in current version of the file and absent
  in the previous are treated as 'Added';
- Lines, present only in previous version of the file and
  absent in the current are treated as 'Removed';
- If a line is 'Removed' and 'Added' at the same time, it is
  treated as 'Changed'.

Text files are compared line by line. It means, that an atomic
part of the comparison is a 'line', terminated with 'newline
character sequence' (usually, +{backslash}n+ or +{backslash}r{backslash}n+)
or end-of-file. Let's call it Section. So, in plain text file 'Section'
represents a line of text. It is the simplest way of comparing files and
very useful for code sources, configuration files, plain-text documentation,
etc.

Although, there are formats for which atomic 'Section' can't be represented
as just a line. For example:

- In XHTML, XML, and related formats 'Section' is represented as a fragment
  of text wrapped in 'Opening' and 'Closing' tags. For example,
  ++<p>Single section</p>++. Also, it is not mandatory that such sections
  must fit on single line only. Moreover, one section may contain others
  (example: ++<p>Section with <b>bold text</b> inside</p>++).
- In Wiki, AsciiDoc, Markdown and other text-based markup languages
  'Section' is a fragment of text, defined by the syntax of corresponding
  language (header, paragraph, etc.).
- In RTF files sections are defined with RTF tags.

More formally, comparing should be possible by any kind of section, specified
by format of the file, not only line by line.
